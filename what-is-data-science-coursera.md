# Summary: What Do Data Scientists Do?
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 

- Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices.
- There are many paths to a career in data science; most, but not all, involce math, programming, and curiosity about data.
- New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental, and argumentative.
- The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.
- Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data.
- Some key data science related terms taught in this lesson include: outliers, model, algorithm, JSON, XML, CSV, and regression.

# Summary: Deep Learning and Machine Learning

- Big Data has five characteristics:  velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value.
- The five cloud computing characteristics are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling,   rapid elasticity, and measured service.
- Data mining has a six-step process: goal setting, selecting data sources, preprocessing, transforming, mining, and evaluation.
- The availability of so many disparate amounts of data created by people, tools, and machines requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to drive transformation.
- Deep learning utilizes neural networks to teach itself patterns in inputs and outputs. Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to learn about data and make predictions without explicitly programming the analysis methods into the system.
- Regression identifies the strength and amount of the correlation between one or more inputs and an output.
- Skills involved in processing Big Data include the application of statistics, machine learning models, and some computer programming.
